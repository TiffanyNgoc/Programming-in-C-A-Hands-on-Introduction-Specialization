// Write a program that divides 7 by 2 and prints out the result (3.5) without using the printf() command. Your program must do the following things:
// Declare two variables and assign them to the appropriate values, and use them to calculate your quotient of 3.5.
// Include just one division (/) operator in your code.
// Use just one cout << statement.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  
  //add code below this line

int num = 7;
int denom = 2;

cout << (double)num / denom << endl;

  //add code above this line
  
  return 0;
  
}
