// Problem
// Write a program that reads a text file and prints the contents in reverse order.
// Expected Output
// You may add additional helper functions if you’d like, but your program must include the following line of code:
// string path = argv[1];
// The variable path allows for different text files to be sent to your program for testing. The TRY IT button below will send a test file to your program. You should see the following output:
// The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.
// ‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’
// ‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M. Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’
// ‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’
// He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’
// Note that there are newlines at the end of a few sentences!
