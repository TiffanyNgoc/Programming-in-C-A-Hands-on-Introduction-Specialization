// Write a program that takes input from a user and prints the first character of the input and the last character with some context. For example, if baseball is the string, then the program will output b is the first character and l is the last character. If cat is the string, then c is the first character and t is the last character will be printed.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  
  string my_string = (argv[1]);
  
  //add code below this line



  //add code above this line
  
  return 0;
  
}
// Requirements
// You should not make any changes to the code that already exists. If you accidentally delete any existing code, you can copy and paste the entire program from above.
// You can use any number of string functions and conditionals to produce the desired output.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  
  string my_string = (argv[1]);
  
  //add code below this line

char first = my_string.at(0);
char last = my_string.at(my_string.length()-1);

cout << first << " is the first character and " << last << " is the last character" << endl;

  //add code above this line
  
  return 0;
