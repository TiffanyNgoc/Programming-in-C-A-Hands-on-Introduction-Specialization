// Like in Exercise 4, your task is to develop a function called IsPalindrome() that takes a string as a parameter. If the string is a palindrome (a word that is spelled the same forward and backward), then the function will return a boolean of true. If the string is not a palindrome, then false is returned. The difference between this exercise and Exercise 4, however, is that you will need to use a helper function called Reverse() within IsPalindrome(). The Reverse() function takes a string as a parameter and reverses it. Then the reversed string is returned.
// Remember that capitalization matters. For example, "Level" would not be considered a palindrome because uppercase "L" and lowercase "l" are not the same.
// Requirements
// You should not make any changes to the code that already exists. If you accidentally delete any existing code, you can copy and paste the entire program from above.
// You must include the helper function Reverse() within your IsPalindrome() function; otherwise, you will not receive credit for your work!

// Existing Code:
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

string Reverse(string x) {
  string y;
  for (int i = x.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    y += x.at(i);
  }
  return y;
}

//add code below this line



//add code above this line

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  string x = argv[1];
  cout << boolalpha << IsPalindrome(x) << endl;
}

// Solved Code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

string Reverse(string x) {
  string y;
  for (int i = x.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    y += x.at(i);
  }
  return y;
}

//add code below this line

bool IsPalindrome(const string& str) {
    string reversed = Reverse(str);
    return str == reversed;
}

//add code above this line

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  string x = argv[1];
  cout << boolalpha << IsPalindrome(x) << endl;
}
